/*
! Loops in JavaScript:
    - used to perform tasks requiring repetitions
*   Types of Loops in JS:
    - for loop: loops a block of code number of times
    - for in loop: loops through keys of an object
    - for of loop: loops through values of an object (object should be iterable [i.e; array or string])
    - while loop: loops a block based on specific consition
    - do-while loop: while loop variant which runs at least once

*   For Loop:
    - most commonly used loop
    - Syntax:
        for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){
            code to be executed
        }
    - statement 1: is the initialization of loop variable
    - statement 2: is where condition is checked
    - statement 3: is where loop variable is modified (increment/decrement)
    - statement 1 only executes at begining of the loop & that too only one time
    - after each iteration, condition is checked, loop body is run and then modification of variable is done
    - i.e; after modification, we repeat above step until condition becomes false
    - loop body executes only if condition in statement 2 is true
