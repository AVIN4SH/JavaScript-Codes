!   While Loop:
    - executes a block of code while the condition remains true
    - if the condition never becomes false, it leads to an infinite loop and can crash the program
    - Syntax:
        while (condition) {
            code;
            loop variable modification;        
        }

}

/*
!   do-while Loop:
    - a variant of the while loop
    - ensures the loop executes at least once
    - condition is checked after the first execution
    - Syntax:
        do {
            code;
        } while (condition);
